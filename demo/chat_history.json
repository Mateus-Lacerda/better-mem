She becomes involved with a wealthy and cunning German named Larry Douglas.\n\nCatherine, on the other hand, is an American socialite and pilot, engaged to Larry before World War II. After Larry’s apparent betrayal and disappearance during the war, Catherine’s life takes a dark turn.\n\nAfter the war, Noelle and Larry seek revenge and power, leading to a dangerous game of love, deception, and betrayal that ultimately forces the characters to confront their darkest desires and the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe novel is full of suspense, dramatic twists, and explores themes of love, obsession, and revenge, set against the backdrop of wartime and post-war events.\n\nDoes this jog your memory?

Based on your description — a man who gets tricked in Africa and then builds a diamond empire, with the story following his heirs — it sounds like you're referring to **\"Rage of Angels\"** or perhaps **\"The Sands of Time\"**?\n\nHowever, \"Rage of Angels\" is more about a young lawyer, and \"The Sands of Time\" deals more with art and history rather than diamonds.\n\nCould it be **\"The Doomsday Conspiracy\"**? Or perhaps another author?\n\nIf it's really about a diamond empire and family saga, it might be:\n\n- **\"Master of the Game\"** by Sidney Sheldon. That book is about Kate Blackwell, a powerful businesswoman building a global empire, inherited from her father who was involved in the diamond business in Africa. It tells the story of multiple generations of the family. \n\nIs \"Master of the Game\" the book you're thinking of?"

Focus on whole foods, adequate protein, and controlled calorie intake.\n7. **Cardio:** Incorporate regular cardio sessions like running, cycling, or HIIT to help with calorie burn.\n\n### Consistency \u0026 Patience\n8. **Regular Training:** Aim for 3-4 sessions per week focusing on upper body strength, skill practice, and conditioning.\n9. **Rest \u0026 Recovery:** Allow your body to recover with rest days and sufficient sleep.\n\nWould you like me to help design a sample weekly workout plan based on these steps?"
